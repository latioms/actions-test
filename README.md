# Getting Started with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation feature provided by GitHub that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your repository. It helps automate various workflows, making your development process more efficient.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) service provided by GitHub. It enables you to automate tasks such as building and testing your code, running scripts, and deploying applications. With GitHub Actions, you can define custom workflows using YAML files directly in your repository.

## How to Use GitHub Actions

### 1. Creating Workflow Files

To get started, create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. Inside this directory, you can add YAML files that define your workflows. For example, create a file named `ci-cd.yml`.

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on each push to the `main` branch. It checks out the repository, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests.

### 2. Commit and Push

Commit your workflow file and push it to your repository.

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD workflow"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Check Workflow Status

Visit the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repository to see the status of your workflow. GitHub Actions will automatically run the defined workflow whenever a push event occurs on the specified branch.

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions simplifies the automation of your software development workflows. By defining workflows in your repository, you can automate tasks and streamline your development process. Explore the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to discover and use pre-built actions to enhance your workflows.
